                <p dir="ltr" class="heavy">Overview:</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Welcome to Pedal!  We are a pay as you go, and monthly subscription service that gives our members access to the best fitness gyms, studios, and activities in their city.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">The Pedal website (the “Site”) is operated by Pedal LLC. (“Pedal”).</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Please read carefully the following Terms of Use, which may be updated by Pedal from time to time without notice to you (the Terms of Use, as modified from time to time, the “Terms”).  The most current version of the Terms can be accessed at any time at <a href="http://pedal.com/#/terms">Terms of Service</a></p>
                <p dir="ltr" class="heavy">1.      Acceptance of Terms of Use</p>
                <p dir="ltr">By accessing, browsing, and/or using the Site, you accept and agree to be bound to these Terms.  In addition, when using particular Pedal LLC services, you also shall be subject to any posted guidelines, or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted and modified from time to time.</p>
                <p dir="ltr" class="heavy">2.     Membership</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Members receive a visit for each pass purchased(“Eligible Visits”) to be used to visit the gym the purchased pass is for. Members cannot transfer or gift visits to third parties, including other Pedal members.  Pedal reserves the right to increase from time to time in its sole discretion the number of Eligible Visits a member can take in a given cycle (such as pursuant to certain promotions that we may offer from time to time).   Pedal makes no guarantee on the availability of classes as access to classes is on a space-available basis.</p>
                <p dir="ltr" class="heavy">3.     Membership Cycle</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Pay as you go membership will be billed automatically on a per use basis.You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, “Payment Method”) to use Pedal LLC. </p>
                <p dir="ltr" class="heavy">4.     Billing </p>
                <p dir="ltr">a) By starting your Pedal membership, you authorize us to charge you at the day pass price listed on Pedal mobile application or website, for the chosen gym. You also authorize us to charge you any other fees you may incur in connection with your use of the Site, such as any applicable sign-up fee, taxes or cancellation or late fees, as further explained below.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">b) No Refunds. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">c) Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by emailing us by logging into your Pedal account on the website or mobile app. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, “Cancellation” below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">d) Reservation and Cancellation of Classes. As a Pedal member you must reserve and cancel your Pedal classes only through the Pedal website or mobile application. It is a breach of your Pedal subscription terms if you cancel a class directly with a Venue, including through any online or mobile account you have with a Venue. If you cancel directly with such Venue, we reserve the right to charge you the full amount that the Venue charges for such class and/or any applicable cancellation fees, and/or to terminate your subscription. In addition to your membership fee, you are responsible for paying cancellation fees or missed class fees if you do not cancel your class with appropriate notice or do not attend your scheduled class. Currently, we charge $15 for any class you cancel less than 12 hours notice and $20 for missed classes.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">e) Cancellation. With the pay as you go plan there is no cancellation requirements due to no recurring billing.  You may simply just stop using the Pedal mobile application.</p>
                <p dir="ltr" class="heavy">5.      Other Fees</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Your Pedal membership covers your access to classes and admittance to gyms, studios, and activities. Some of our venues may also charge equipment or other amenity fees. The Pedal membership only gives you access to the class for which you signed up. The venue may have additional fees for use of additional classes or spaces.</p>
